## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Functional Javascript
- Parcel V2
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm exploring more about bundlers and I will continue to do that! Parcel is pretty easy, just set up the scripts and then play with it. I was thinking about getting into bundlers like Vite or Snowpack that uses the unbundled development technique and it's just amazing. I'm learning Webpack as well, currently I'm working in a few react projects with them and I was thinking about learning a little bit about Rollup because Vite uses it under the hood for production build.
